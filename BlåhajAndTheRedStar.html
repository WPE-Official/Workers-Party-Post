<h2>Blåhaj and the Red Star: Modern Revolutionary Iconography</h2>

<h3>On the Old Sickle and Hammer</h3>Many in the modern day question usage of the Hammer and Sickle - in particular living memory, I was likened to a Nazi for wearing it by a Reactionary soon-to-be Police Officer; and so, in writing this I seek to ask: what symbols should brand our movement?
<br><br>It has become a common trend amongst Reformists to denouce anything that has ties to a historical, particularly successful, struggle - the Hammer and Sickle can surely be seen as an example, and it's message of unity betwixt Peasant and Urban Worker is -naturally- most upsetting to the Big and Petit-Bourgeois alike.<br>
It could be said, however, that blindly using its symbol is an exact form of the "Soviet Orthodoxy" that the Deviatonist "28 Bolsheviks" of the early Communist Party of China displayed, in rigidly adhering to an innapplicable example - after all: does England have a Peasantry?<br><br>
You will surely find the answer to be a reasounding: "No!"
<br><br>
Further, you can surely see our Party's Emblem -as of writing this- bears no hammer are sickle, instead a rose sprouting from atop an AK-47; it was chosen to be such as the Rifle represents our preparedness for Armed Struggle, yet the Rose symbolises our committment to Peace and the Masses of the People of England -in the long term- and in particular, it should be noted that the rose has been an English Symbol for many a year, so demonstrates our Party's unique committment to the English Working Masses.<br>I'm sure you, if thinking in Good Faith and Reason will find these to be much more "core aspects" of the Workers' Party than a non-existant union between the Urban Worker and Rural Peasant Classes.

<h3>Symbols Chosen by the Common People, and the Nature of Democracy</h3>
As firm believers in the Mass Line, it makes complete sense to see which symbols the Oppressed Masses of the World have chosen. A seemingly common choice is that of Blåhaj - a Shark plushie designed by workers for IKEA.<br>Some would immediately jump to accusing this writer of Corporate Association and being "Anti-Worker" as such - yet, was it not Workers who designed Blåhaj? And is it not Workers also who manufacture them? And amongst Workers they're beloved?<br>Blåhaj has emerged as a symbol of transgender people and their struggle for liberation against the Reactionary Confines of "Gender", why should we not endorse such - as the People have given Blåhaj their mandate?<br><br>Trans Symbols for Trans Liberation - it's as simple as.<br>
<h3>Further Thoughts on Symbolism</h3>
It has been shown time and time again that near anything can suffice as symbolism - Mao Zedong's face became synonymous with socialism, as did Che Guevara's with Revolution - co-opted or not by Capitalists, these symbols are near-always primed to be re-seized and reclaimed by the Masses in their Great Struggle.
