<h1>Draft Constitution of the Workers’ Party of England</h1>
<h3>Drafted by Comrade Violet</h3>
<h2>Section 1: General Program</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 1em;">a) The Workers’ Party of England, hereafter referred to as ‘The Party’, is ultimately guided by the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and -most particularly- the Dialectical Materialist method.
<br><br> b) The Party ultimately commits itself to the realisation of World Communism.
<br><br>c)  i) The Party positions itself as the only party in the nation which acts as the Vanguard to the working class and wholly follows the Marxist Line.
<br><p style="margin-left: 2em;">ii)The Party, as the nation’s only truly Marxist party, must diligently work towards the expansion of class consciousness – starting at more small-scale interpersonal methods of deprogramming, and moving outwards to the broader masses and systematic educational efforts.
<p style="margin-left: 1em;"<br>d) The Party ultimately serves the masses of the people within England, looking to advance the working people’s material conditions.
<br><br>e) The Party must be actively engaged in the ideological struggle to bring Marxism-Leninism to the English People, and -as a part of this- must essentially Anglicise it; that is to say, adapt it to the material realities of England and its people, as well as the broader United Kingdom.
</p>
<h2>Section 2: The Party Line</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 1em;">a) The Party Line must essentially conform to material reality and the overarching goals of the party, as established in Subsection 1b.  
<br><br>b) The specifics of the Party Line can only be decided by the Party’s members, who must first act as amiable representatives of the masses, so as The Party Line can be democratically decided.
<br><br>c) Fundamentally, the Party must operate from the principle of Democratic Centralism, which outlines that we must be ‘Diverse in Opinion, but Unified in Action’, that is to say: the will of the party, having been decided by the masses, should be adhered to in the field.
<br><br>d) The Party, acting as a bastion of Proletarian Democracy, must settle matters democratically – any questions of the policy must be raised, such that they can be settled through the processes of criticism and self-criticism, once -however- an issue has been resolved, it is considered poor practise to raise it again, unless surrounding conditions have undergone adequate transformation.
</p>
<h2>Section 3: Practical Organisation</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 1em;">a) The Party should, overall, aim towards a more decentralised organisation – allowing various cadres and branches to share in broad responsibility, and while The Party remains of a notably small size, all appointments should be subject to referendum.
<br><br>b) Overall, Party Cadres should aim to organise for congresses to be convened -as frequently as possible- where the entire party can gather in the spirits of discussion, dispute and strategy.
<br><br>c) The Party should concentrate its aims on it’s Headquarter Town.
<br><br>d) i) Generally speaking, Party Cadres should first focus their educational efforts where they believe they shall be most fruitful, and only later attempt more risky endeavours.
<br><p style="margin-left: 2em;">ii) Specifically, however Cadres at in Schooling should concentrate their efforts on other students and teachers at the school for as long as they attend.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1em;">e) i) Cadres should by no means shy from Practical Struggle, whether it take the form of learning trade skills or involving themselves in Union organisation; we Communists never shy from work, and know well that -with diligence- we can fell any mountain, great or small.
<br><p style="margin-left: 2em;">ii) Overall, the Rank and File of The Party should both be prepared to join already existing organisations, as well as not being afraid of staring new ones – it is the duty of all Cadres to creatively apply Marxism-Leninism to solve problems, and further the advancement of the working people; so let us fear not the struggles along that path.
</p>
<h2>Section 4: Anti-Revisionism</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 1em;">a) The Party must act to prevent the spread of all form of False Consciousness, and Revisionism is a farm of such; we uphold Mao Zedong’s “Unity, Criticism, Unity”  Method in order to do so and believe wholeheartedly in the efficacy of the “Rectification Movement” Model and seek to extensively implement it, as did the Communist Party of the Philippines – expanding upon Mao Zedong’s original method.
<br><br>b) The Party thoroughly decries the Revisionist and Reactionary lines of our contemporaries in the United Kingdom – particularly: the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist), Communist Party of Britain and the Workers' Party of Great Britain; all three have essentially betrayed the working people, one way or another, and have adopted lines incompatible with that of the masses.
