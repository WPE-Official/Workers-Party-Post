<h2>The Trans Genocide: A Communist Perspective</h2>
<small>Written by Comrade Violet, Published 11th of March, 2024</small>
<h3>Genocide? Where?</h3>
The Genocide against Transgender people <i>is</i> ongoing - occuring primarily in the Imperial Core (USA and UK, especially) it looks to reinforce the Reactionary Gender Binary and flare up divisions amongst the common people - so the cishet relative-to-others elite can work to crush trans people under their reactionary boot, taking out their Rage at Capitalism-Imperialism upon it's victims, in a cruel irony.<br>
The Primary Weapons of the Trans Genocide are Legislation and Lynching - each of which reinforcing the other, through a dialectical relation that feeds systemic violence with itself; the Reactionary and Bourgeois Right-Wing have made it a clear focus of theirs to "expose" transgender plots to "groom children", yet we see this for what it is - the 21st Century's "Judeo Bolshevism", these conspiracies lay the groundwork for violence - and violence there is!
<br><h3>Complicit Groups - and a Refutation of Vulgar Materialism</h3>
Unfortunately, there are many who are Complicit with this - from the teachers who enforce reactionary laws that demand parents must be informed of their childs gender identity (which clearly endangers them and erodes relations in the School), to the Demagogues of the Fascist Republican and Democrat Parties in the US and the Tory-Labour lot in our own "United" Kingdom.<br>However, disturbingly, many "Communists" and "Socialists" collaborate in this Vile Project; in particular, we've seen the "Communist" Party of Great Britain ("Marxist-Leninist") uphold a reactionary, bourgeois line that relies on assumptions of Binary, "Biological" Gender as the norm, and unquestionable - suddenly couching themselves in idealism they disguise as materialism.<br><br>For example, when the CPGB-ML stated: "Under the influence of of liberal academia, there is a growing band of 'socialists' who wish to rebel not against injustice, but against reality itself: "if one is assigned the gender-division of “male” at birth" (you are biologically male)", they posit that the norms of gender that arose, like marriage and "Nuclear Family" (as Engles illustrated)  for the emerging land-ownder to transmit their wealth and create Class itself - and by upholding such, they ignore the material reality of gender (which has varied far beyond the binary except in white, European Societies - of which these "Communists" are always part) and prevent the abolition of Capitalism and Class in the long-term.<br><br>Furthermore, they sell out actual trans communists to the far-right, imperial agents and leave communists at large in a much more precarious position in the field of discussion, slandering us all as reactionaries!
<br><br>
It is very clear to us that they are demonstrating a form of right-wing, idealist obsession with the aesthetics of "materialism" and "science" which disregards reality, and -in pure arrogance- lets them define their own reality and claim it as a Universal, which must be dogmatically adhered to.
<br>
<h3>What then must be done?</h3>
Firstly, we must bring out for struggle all those who uphold the far-right line and collaborate in the slaughter of common people and serve imperialist-capitalists in sowing division; clearly, this reationary line should be exposed - and it must be the general public who do so, strident in their efforts to denounce this deviation!<br>I would personally direct that the likes of George Galloway, the far-righter who swept up victory in Rochdale's recent by-election, Joti Brar -the CPGB-ML's Princess- and the CPB at large for their dangerous Transmedicalist line - but that's merely a shortlist of suggestions to you, dear readers.
<br><br>More than Critique however, we must campaign, argue openly with those that promote transphobic rhetoric, and condemn to destruction those that participate in the legislature or lynching against trans people!<br><br>
It is, yet more so than ever, 'Right to Rebel', dear Comrades!
